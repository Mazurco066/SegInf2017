because the practice of the basic movements of kata is the focus and mastery of self is the
essence of matsubayashi ryu karate do i shall try to elucidate the movements of the kata 
according to my interpretation based on forty years of study it is not an easy task to 
explain each movement and its significance and some must remain unexplained to give a 
complete explanation one would have to be qualified and inspired to such an extent that he 
could reach the state of enlightened mind capable of recognizing soundless sound and 
shapeless shape i do not deem myself the final authority but my experience with kata has 
left no doubt that the following is the proper application and interpretaion i offer my 
theories in the hope that the essence of okinawan karate will remain intact
